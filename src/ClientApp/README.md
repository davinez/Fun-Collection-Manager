A more detailed list of the included packages can be found in the [Installed Packages](#installed-packages) section. Packages not shown above include Devtools, ui helper libraries, and eslint plugins/configs.

## Requirements

- [NodeJS 18+](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) (or equivalent)

If you'd like to use the included Dockerfile then [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is required as well:

## Getting Started

**Note**: This project comes with two git hooks added by [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/). A prepare-commit-msg hook to run the [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#readme) cli for those nice commit messages and a commit-msg hook to run [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) on the message itself. Commitlint will ensure the commit message follows the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) (it will if you used commitizen).

If you wish to remove any hooks, simply delete the corresponding file in the .husky directory.

## Important Note

1. [Faker](https://fakerjs.dev/) is included to encourage more isolated testing and allow for rapid development of demos and MVPs. However, please make note that, [due to a bug](https://github.com/faker-js/faker/issues/1791), importing Faker from the main package (without a locale) will result in the entire Faker lib being imported causing bundle sizes to increase up to 2+ MB. Instead prefer [localized imports](https://fakerjs.dev/guide/localization.html#individual-localized-packages) as shown below.

   ```
   // import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker';
   import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker/locale/en'; // prefer localization when possible
   ```

   The imported lib will instead be around 600 KB. Nonetheless, Faker should **NOT** be used in production and instead be limited to testing and demos.

## Testing

Unit testing is handled by React Testing Library and Vitest while End-to-End (E2E) Testing is conducted by Playwright.

If you'd like to run all tests, Unit and E2E alike, execute the following command:

```
pnpm run test
```

### Unit Testing

When running unit test scripts, it is assumed that unit tests will be colocated with the source files. Take a look at the placeholder README file in `src/components` for [an example](src/components/README.md).

If you'd like to execute unit tests specifically, the below command will execute vitest:

```
pnpm run test:unit
```

If instead you are interested in coverage reporting, run:

```
pnpm run test:unit:coverage
```

All unit tests run in watch mode by default. If you'd like to disable watch mode, change the package.json test scripts with the following

before:

```
"scripts": {
  	"test:unit": "vitest src/",
	"test:unit:coverage": "vitest --coverage src/"
}
```

After:

```
"scripts": {
  	"test:unit": "vitest run src/",
	"test:unit:coverage": "vitest run --coverage src/"
}
```

**Note**: Faker is included to provide mock data. See the [Important Notes](#important-notes) section for crucial details regarding this package. Specifically, point 4.

### End-to-End (E2E) Testing

Running E2E tests use a similar syntax to running unit tests:

```
pnpm run test:e2e
```

If you wish to see the reports, run:

```
pnpm run test:e2e:report
```

## Preparing for Deployment

Instructions are provided for deploying both with and without Docker. Both options still require a platform to host the application.

### Without Docker

Deploying is as easy as running

```
pnpm run build
```

and pointing your web server to the generated `index.html` file found at `dist/index.html`

### With Docker

A Dockerfile with an [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com) base image is also provided for quick and easy deployments. Simply execute the following commands:

1. `pnpm run build`
2. `docker build . -t <container_name>`
   - Example: `docker build . -t todo-app`
3. `docker run  -p <port_number>:80 <container_name>`
   - Example: `docker run todo-app -p 8080:80`

### Continuous Integration

-- Pending

## Devtools

- [@hookform/DevTools](https://react-hook-form.com/dev-tools) - React Hook Form Devtools to help debug forms with validation

**React Hook Form DevTools** icon can be recognized in the top right corner of the page by the pink React Hook Form clipboard logo. A utility component has also provided. Like the TanStack Table Devtools component above, a prop must be passed from a specific hook. In this case, it is the control prop from the `useForm()` hook. Similar to TanStack Table, use of React Hook Form DevTools requires the component be added to each unique form. More information can be found in the [React Hook Form DevTools documentation](https://react-hook-form.com/dev-tools).
